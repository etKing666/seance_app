                    <p align="justify">SEANCE is a threat modelling framework tailored for micro businesses (i.e., businesses with fewer than 10 employees and a turnover of no more than €2 million). It is a non-technical, asset-centric framework that aims to be easily understood and used by micro business (MB) owners who do not have the cybersecurity expertise or resources (i.e. financial and otherwise) to use an existing framework, tool, or system to identify the threats to their business. </p>

                    <p align="justify">The SEANCE framework provides for threats to be considered and assessed in six layers, with the general assumption that the most dangerous threat is the closest threat. Therefore, when considering threats to your business, you should think about <b>your:</b></p>

                    <p align="justify">You can think of your organisation as a medieval castle: The lord (or commander for that matter) of the castle makes all the important decisions <strong>himself</strong> that have an impact on the whole castle. His army of warriors (in local jargon, his <strong>employees</strong>) carry out his decisions by using their weapons and other <strong>assets</strong> in accordance with his wishes. This is not an individual endeavour, however; it requires a castle-wide <strong>network</strong> to coordinate the deployment of weapons and smaller units, with the ultimate goal of keeping the castle's defensive posture in sync. Then there are the people who live within the castle's perimeter, who are usually unaware of their lord's important defensive decisions, and who are more concerned with the livelihood of their household, paying their lord to be exempted from military service - perhaps that's why the lord mocks them by referring to them as his <strong>customers</strong> at his festive dinners (where he may consume too much beer). The castle's <strong>environment</strong> then has a huge impact on the castle's security: Unlike a peaceful castle on a remote island, about which the local population hears (and dreams) a lot, the castle is surrounded by the castles of malevolent neighbouring kingdoms. The lord tries to fortify the castle by digging deep moats around it, filling them with water and putting hungry alligators in them. But there is one thing to remember: No matter what he does to fortify the perimeter, the castle is only as strong as the resilience of the lord and the integrity of his army! Therefore, the ruler prioritises threats from the inside of his castle over those from the outside.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p align="justify">Please note that SEANCE Micro Business Threat Modelling Framework is not intended to be a complete cyber security solution for micro businesses, but rather to improve their cyber security posture by raising awareness of cyber threats and providing a starting point for implementing industry standard security controls.</p>
                    <p align="justify">Let's now dive into the six layers of the SEANCE framework, starting from the innermost layer and working our way outwards. You may notice that some themes, such as "Setting up firewalls", appear in more than one layer, because they are relevant to different layers.</p>

Think of it like a team of friends who can easily talk, share photos, or even work on projects together, regardless of where they are. This setup helps your business run more efficiently, enabling tasks like sending emails, sharing files, and accessing the internet seamlessly.</p>

As they are the most important group of people outside the organisation, you should carefully manage the relationship between customers and business assets. On the other hand, although they are external to the organisation, customers need to penetrate the external boundaries of the organisation in a structured way in order to receive services from you.</p>
