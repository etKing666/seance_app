If you are not yet familiar with the SEANCE Framework, we recommend that you take a look at the <a href="{%  url 'about' %}">About SEANCE Framework</a> page to get an idea of how it works.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">The questions are non-technical and we provide links to reputable sources for some terms that might be challenging for you. It should not take more than 15 minutes to get the threat model and overall risk score of your business.</p>
